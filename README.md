# DayzPortals

Craftable portals for DayZ, after Valheim's: build two, tune them to the same frequency, and
touching one plate puts you at the other. In DayZ they're the **Pereval transit apparatus
(Object 47)**, a Soviet field gate that was clearly never meant to leave the test range.
For now the gate is kit-bashed from vanilla models; a proper model can replace it later
without touching the logic. Targets DayZ 1.30 (stable since 2026-10). Server and client.

## Playing it

1. **Crate it:** combine an *electronic repair kit* with *metal wire* in your hands. You get
   a *Pereval apparatus (crated)*. It's heavy, so it goes in your hands only.
2. **Place it** from your hands like a fence kit. The hologram shows the whole gate.
3. **Fit the parts** into its inventory: 10 *metal sheets*, *metal wire*, a *truck battery*
   and a *walkie-talkie*.
4. **Assemble it** with a *hammer* in your hands. This uses up the parts. The ring stands
   up, the mist comes on and the rim starts to spark.
5. **Tune it:** look at the cabinet and use *Tune up* / *Tune down*. There are 20
   channels, 412.0-421.5 MHz in 0.5 MHz steps. A new gate starts on a random channel.
6. **Go through:** walk up to the plate, from either side. You come out 2.6 m in front of
   another assembled gate on the same frequency. If more than two gates share a frequency,
   the field picks one at random.

The interlock won't send anyone carrying **ammunition or explosives**: loose rounds, loaded
magazines, a chambered or internally loaded gun, grenades (smoke is fine), mines and
charges. Empty guns and magazines are fine. *Crate* (hammer) packs a gate back into its
crate: an empty unassembled gate loses nothing, an assembled one loses its parts.

## Layout

- `DayzPortals/` - the mod (packed as-is into a PBO, no binarising).
  - `config.cpp` - `DZP_GateKit`, `DZP_GateHologram`, `DZP_Gate`.
  - `Scripts/4_World/DayzPortals/`
    - `DZP_Layout.c` - where every vanilla piece sits relative to the cabinet, the trigger
      box, the arrival point, the channels and the material counts. **Tune the look here.**
    - `DZP_Decor.c` - spawns the pieces as local, non-persistent objects on the server
      (for collision) and on each client (for looks).
    - `DZP_Gate.c` - the gate: frequency, assembly, crating, persistence, ambience.
    - `DZP_GateRegistry.c` - server: watches the plates (every 250 ms), runs the
      contraband check and the jump.
    - `DZP_GateKit.c` - the crate, and the placement hologram.
    - `DZP_Actions.c`, `DZP_Hooks.c` - tune/assemble/crate actions, the recipe, and the
      vanilla hooks (`ActionConstructor`, `PluginRecipesManagerBase`, `Hammer`, `PlayerBase`).
- `ServerFiles/types.xml` - CE entries. Without them the gates don't persist. Register the
  file in the mission's `cfgeconomycore.xml` with a `<ce folder="...">` block.

## Building and testing

The build and test tooling lives in `~/Projects/DayZMissions`. `mods/DayzPortals` there is
a symlink to this project's `DayzPortals/`, and the `portals.chernarusplus` mission loads it
as a `local` mod:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/DayZMissions
tools/test.sh portals          # headless: builds, assembles, contraband check, a scripted jump
KEEP=1 tools/test.sh portals   # same, on the last run's persistence (gates must survive)
tools/run_server.sh portals    # play it: you spawn next to an assembled gate at Balota
tools/run_client.sh portals    #   linked to one at the NW airfield, with kits and parts
```

`tools/build_mod.py mods/DayzPortals build` (from DayZMissions) builds and signs
`build/@DayzPortals` on its own.

## Not checked in game yet

The headless test covers the logic. These need a client:

- The look has been checked from the front and side (`screenshots/`), with
  `tools/run_server.sh portals -tour=1`: the server walks the player round the gate every
  12 s. Still unseen: the unbuilt gate (blast door lying flat), and the hologram.
- The placement hologram, the attachment slots in the inventory screen and the action texts.
- The mist, the sparks and the sounds (only a faint puff and sparks were visible) (all vanilla: contaminated-area gas, lever sparks,
  bunker hum, defibrillator).
- The jump on a real client. Server-side `SetPosition` is what admin tools use, so it
  should be fine.
